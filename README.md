# MARVEL - Metagenomic Analysis and Retrieval of Viral Extended Sequences

MARVEL is a pipeline for recovery of complete phage genomes from whole community shotgun metagenomic sequencing data. The tools was divided in three components:
   * **generate_bins_from_reads.py** - Generate bins from whole community shotgun reads
   * **marvel_bins.py** - Machine learning prediction of phage bins
   * **function_driven_analyses.py** - Analyze specific genes of interest within phage bins

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
